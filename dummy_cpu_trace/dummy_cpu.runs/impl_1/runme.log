CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-1055] Clock 'clk' completely overrides clock 'clk_i', which is referenced by one or more other constraints. Any constraints that refer to the overridden clock will be ignored.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name clk [get_ports clk_i], [E:/codefield/cpu/dummy_cpu/clock.xdc:1]
Previous: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports clk_i], [e:/codefield/cpu/dummy_cpu/dummy_cpu.srcs/sources_1/ip/cpuclk/cpuclk.xdc:56]
Resolution: Review the constraint files and remove the redundant clock definition(s). If the clock constraints are not saved in a file, you can first save the constraints to an XDC file and reload the design once the constraints have been corrected.

WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_cpu/u_pc/bbstub_spo[6] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_cpu/u_pc/branch_reg_reg_i_2/O, cell u_cpu/u_pc/branch_reg_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
